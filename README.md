#Getting/Cleaning Data on Coursera

##Peer review assessment


This R script creates a tidy dataset of data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The original data are located here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The R script will download the data, install required packages, read in the data, and manipulate it to print a tidy data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For details on each step of the process, see the comments in the R script.
